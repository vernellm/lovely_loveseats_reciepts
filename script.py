# Project from Codecademy titled Receipts for Lovely Loveseats
#
# In this project, I will be storing the names and prices of a furniture storeâ€™s catalog in variables.
# I will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

# First we have to calculate the sales tax on the total

# Adding that tax to the customer's total
